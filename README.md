### Hi there 👋
My name is Eli, I am a Musician & Dev.
- 🔭 I’m currently working as the Lead Technical Coordinator @ [tie.cx](https://tie.cx "Bio links made better and free.") & as a Project Leader @ [The Rickard Group](https://rickard.co)
- 🎶 I’m currently listening to Jon Bellion's The Definition
- 📫 How to reach me: [tie.cx/eli](https://tie.cx/eli)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I write a lot of code, most of it broken.

#### The majority of my work has been made private or archived here on Github for as a result of either it's sensitive nature or relation to project Orion, if you need me for something relating to that I ask that you please refrain, otherwise you're more than welcome to contact me.
